# hate-maintainers
conservative fucks. fuck them.

## who are we

this is team red, venting our hate against team blue

* we like to be explicit, we like to find truth
* we like to solve problems, not just hide them

## bad taste and hostage taking

> its interesting that [bad taste](https://neilonsoftware.com/difficult-people-on-software-projects/developers/the-incompetent/) and [hostage taking](https://neilonsoftware.com/difficult-people-on-software-projects/developers/the-hostage-taker/) so often appear together.  
> probably both are facets of the same personality type (conservative)

> in the real world, i would kill the tyrant, and install someone who is "less bad".  
> in the digital world? lets just pretend this never happened ... "muh ideals!"

## provocation

conservative types produce a constant stream of

* passive violence
* provocations
* passive-aggressive behavior

to provoke aggressions of "the others" (liberal types)

we also see this in "provocative" clothing, like whore costumes

## mating call

basically, this is a mating call between "two worlds"

we say

* they deserve each other
* opposites attract
* mutual completion
* conjunctio oppositorum

## to play or not to play

this is a "game" they play, and we always have the choice

* do we join their game
* do we refuse to play their game

what would bender do? [start a new project, with blackjack and hookers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-94qrgxH35M#title=Bender%20-%20Blackjack%20and%20Hookers)

## everyone feels right

all this behavior has its logic, everyone feels he is right,  
but its still fucked, and there must be a better solution

## slave morality

people who follow slave morality love to do everything "wrong".  
to them, [machiavelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli) and [orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell) are not critics but prophets

in other words:

* they are masochists
* they love to suffer
* they seek and produce "hell on earth", in the hope for a "paradise in heaven"
  * paradise in their mind
  * [head in the clouds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qysk6IgeFmQ#title=slade%20-%20far%20far%20away%201975)
  * [always look on the bright side of life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHPOzQzk9Qo)

## authoritarian parenting style

* high demands + low effort
* demanding + lazy

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting_styles

sounds familiar? cos its a natural tendency of "some people"

## lazy

laziness is a popular excuse to reject patches (what kids these days call "pull requests")

* i dont want to maintain this
* i want this different, but you implement it
* i am never happy, but good luck trying to appease me

## rich hearts wear poor coats

* only criminals must hide in a sheepskin
* only destroyers must be polite

## how many

"they" are not a minority, but also not a majority.  
lets say they are exactly half of all humans.  
so, if you have a village of 144 people, then 72 people are conservative.

if you say "they are too many", then you probably mean [overpopulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC5z4LV7dCY#title=A%20Perfect%20Circle%20-%20Let's%20Have%20A%20War)
which can only be solved by [rapid depopulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGG0Nq3BwqQ#title=Delete%20The%20Garbage.%20World%20Cure.%20RD9%20Virus.%20The%20Brothers%20Grimsby%202016) (aka "mass murder")

## he who must not be named

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Voldemort

> If you want to know who rules over you,  
> just look for who you are not allowed to criticize.

> Voltaire

* who is on the top of the "hierarchy of victims" (german: hierarchie der opfer)
* who will completely fuck your life if you talk bad about him?
* who enforces censorship of "hate speech" on all platforms? (except [gab.com](https://news.gab.com/2021/12/02/gab-is-not-for-sale/) and some .onion domains)

## both are right

or at least, both "feel" right in their predictions,  
and only real-life experiments can reveal the truth = who was right = who had the right prediction

this is the problem of the judgement of solomon:  
king solomon assumes that only one is right ...  
some see this as "wisdom" of a king,  
others prefer to call this "a simple solution for simple minds"

## quo bono

when two argue, a third wins

commercial projects win, cos they are generally better organized than "fun projects".  
there, every wrong decision has real-world effects (loss of money)

in "fun projects", people are more ready to waste energy (ignore potential improvements, ignore potential problems),  
cos the real-world effects are less visible
